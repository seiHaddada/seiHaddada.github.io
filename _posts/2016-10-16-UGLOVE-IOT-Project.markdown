## **Introduction:**   
#### What is Uglove ?

As part of our studies, we have to create an innovativ project that can be presented for windows imagin cup
or any other international challenge.after a very long period of brain storming we got the ideaof creating 
a mobile Dj station; it is reassembling the most important things of a DJ station in a glove and a mobile application. The glove will detect the gesture of the person's hand and emit the data to the connected phone ,(IOS/android/windows phone). Moreover, the user can control the tempo, the synchronization, the frequency of the sound and add all the preferred effects with only a fingertip, it is never been easier than that. It's designed for people who care enough about their music, the easiness of use makes it accessible for non experienced people and the variety of features make it a very good choice for professionals too. 

## **Technologies/Resources Used in the Application:**

* Flex Sensor 2.2”: simple flex sensor 2.2" in length. As the sensor is flexed, the resistance across the sensor increases, the resistance of the flex sensor changes when the metal pads are on the outside of the bend.

* Accelerometer: a three axis accelerometer for the LilyPad system. Based on the ADXL335 MEMS accelerometer from Analog Devices, the LilyPad Accelerometer can detect joint movement as well as inclination and vibration.

* BLE Nano:is one of the smallest Bluetooth 4.1 Low Energy (BLE) development boards in the market,supports numerous different wireless devices running iOS 7/8, Android 4.3 or higher, and Windows Phone 8.1 

* Battery-2000mAh: very slim, extremely light weight batteries based on the new Polymer Lithium Ion chemistry.

* This is the highest energy density currently in production. Each cells outputs a nominal 3.7V at 2000mAh

* RFM12B-S2:is a great inexpensive option for wireless communication; it’s an ISM band FSK transceiver module implemented with a unique PLL. These modules operate in the 915MHZ band and fully comply with FCC and ETSI regulations.

* Arduino Pro Mini 328-3.3V: This is a 3.3V Arduino running the 8MHz bootloader.

* 30FT (Stainless Steel) 

## **Claims for Inorpi:**
1. mixing device which consist of two gloves that control a mobile application (1), each glove contain 
an <<arduino mini pro>> a movement sensor an accelerometer, a radio frequency and bluetooth module only in the left glove.

2. Mixing device indicated in the claim (1), characterized by a radio frequency which will permit the communication
between the two gloves and bluetooth module to communicate with the application.

3. Mixing device indicated in the precedent claims ,characterized with a mobile application that gives the DJ functionnalties.
